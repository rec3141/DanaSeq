# dānaSeq

Genomics-Based Ecosystem Service Assessment Tool

"Ecosystem Services" are the benefits that accrue to humans from having a healthy ecosystem. When natural forces or human activities disturb the ecosystem, these benefits may diminish or change. This software takes its name from dāna, the Buddhist concept of selfless giving and generosity in service of others.

dānaSeq conducts real-time analysis of Nanopore sequencing data to identify microbial communities, taxa and genes that affect Ecosystem Services using automated binning, genome assembly, and annotation of marker genes using a custom database of hidden markov models (HMMs) that build upon FOAM (Prestat et al. 2014), CANT-HYD (Khot et al. 2022), NCycDB (Tu et al. 2019), HADEG (Rojas-Vargas et al. 2023), HMDB (Wang et al. 2023), TASmania (Akarsu 2019), IDOPS (Díaz-Valerio et al. 2021).
